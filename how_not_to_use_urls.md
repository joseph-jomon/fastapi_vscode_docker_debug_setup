To dynamically refer to services by their Traefik-configured domain names or paths in your FastAPI application, you can use the service names or paths defined in your Docker and Traefik setup rather than hardcoding the URLs. Here's how you can implement this in your `.py` file:

### **Scenario Recap**
- **Traefik** is set up to route traffic to different services based on domain names or paths.
- **Service URLs** are not hardcoded in your FastAPI application but are instead determined by Traefik's routing configuration.

### **Example Setup**

Assume you have two services:
- **Vector Service**: Exposed at `http://vector-service.local` via Traefik.
- **Search Service**: Exposed at `http://search-service.local` via Traefik.

### **FastAPI Application Code**

Here's how you can dynamically call these services from your FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import httpx

app = FastAPI()

VECTOR_SERVICE_URL = "http://vector-service.local/get_vector"  # Use the Traefik-configured domain
SEARCH_SERVICE_URL = "http://search-service.local/search"  # Use the Traefik-configured domain

@app.get("/process_and_search/{query}")
async def process_and_search(query: str):
    # Step 1: Call the vector service to get the vector
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response_vector = await client.get(f"{VECTOR_SERVICE_URL}?query={query}")
        
        if response_vector.status_code != 200:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Error retrieving vector")
        
        vector = response_vector.json()

    # Step 2: Call the search service with the obtained vector
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response_search = await client.post(SEARCH_SERVICE_URL, json={"vector": vector})
        
        if response_search.status_code != 200:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Error searching with the vector")
        
        search_results = response_search.json()

    return {"query": query, "results": search_results}
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Use Traefik-Configured Domains**:
   - The `VECTOR_SERVICE_URL` and `SEARCH_SERVICE_URL` are set to the domains managed by Traefik (`vector-service.local` and `search-service.local`), which routes requests to the appropriate services running in Docker containers.

2. **Dynamic Service Calls**:
   - Instead of hardcoding the IP addresses or container names, your FastAPI app references services by the domain names configured in Traefik. This approach ensures that even if the actual containers' IPs change, Traefik will handle routing appropriately.

3. **Resilient to Changes**:
   - If you need to change the underlying infrastructure (e.g., moving services to different hosts or scaling them up), you only need to update Traefik's configuration. Your FastAPI app remains the same, making your system more resilient to changes.

### **Traefik Labels in Docker Compose**

Ensure that your Docker Compose file is correctly set up with Traefik labels:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.5
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"

  vector-service:
    image: vector-service-image
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.vector-service.rule=Host(`vector-service.local`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.vector-service.loadbalancer.server.port=8000"  # Assuming your service runs on port 8000

  search-service:
    image: search-service-image
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.search-service.rule=Host(`search-service.local`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.search-service.loadbalancer.server.port=8000"  # Assuming your service runs on port 8000
```

### **Summary**

By using Traefik-configured domain names or paths in your FastAPI application, you eliminate the need to hardcode service URLs. This makes your application more flexible and easier to maintain, especially in dynamic and scalable environments. The services are referred to by their logical names or paths, and Traefik takes care of routing the requests to the appropriate containers, regardless of where they are running.
